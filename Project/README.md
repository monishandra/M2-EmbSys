# Title : Automatic Water Supply Control using Arduino

## About project
This project is simulation project . For designing this project we used simulIDE. And for compilation of c language code we used ArduinoIDE . In this project we can automatically control ths water supply tant in our home. In this project is done by using Arduino. I used Ultrasonic Sensor for measuring water tank . I used Servo motor for opening and closing valve . 
## SOFTWARE USED
  *SIMULIDE:*
         SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and                         microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.
  
  *ARDUINO:*
         Arduino  is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller                kits for building digital devices.
